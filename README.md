# College-Mentor

This project was created to assist students in selecting the best Engineering college for them. I've included some information such as the former cut-off and minimum rank in the jee to get their respective home state NIT, as well as some other details. This project can assist students after their 12th examination and assist them in selecting a good college. There is no charge to students for this project.
